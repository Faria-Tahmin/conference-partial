                    Dr. Md. Sazzad Hossain is a distinguished professor, researcher, academic teaching advisor with
                    extensive experience in ICT sector and a writer. Currently, he is working as a full-time member of
                    University Grants Commission of Bangladesh. He is also a Director of the Board of Directors of
                    Bangladesh Communication Satellite Company Ltd (BCSCL). Dr. Sazzad is a masterly instructor in ICT
                    field with enormous knowledge on the subject matter. He joined as a professor as well as Head of the
                    Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh in December
                    2009. He received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Portland State University,
                    Oregon, USA which is one of the top-ranking universities of the world. His doctoral dissertation in
                    Quantum Computing takes background and ideas from several fields of physics, mathematics, computer
                    science, computer engineering and biology. He completed his Master in Electrical and Computer
                    Engineering from the same university in USA. He received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical
                    System Network Engineering from Moscow Technical University (Popularly known as Moscow Power
                    Institute), Moscow, Russia. He completed his S.S.C from Faujdarhat Cadet College and H.S.C from
                    Chittagong College. Dr. Sazzad taught several advanced courses, such as Introduction to Quantum
                    Computing, VLSI Design, Artificial Intelligence and Human-Robot Interaction. He also lent his
                    teaching and research experiences in many universities and institutes as a visiting
                    faculty/researcher/guest speaker. He has twenty-six (26) years of experience in Information
                    Technology. He has served as a consultant to several nationally and internationally renowned ICT
                    companies, government agencies and organizations. His research interest includes Quantum computing,
                    quantum algorithms, quantum entanglement, decoherence, natural computing, fault-tolerant computing,
                    theoretical computer science, Nano Technology, Low Power VLSI Design, Reversible logic, Software
                    Engineering, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction,
                    Renewable Energy and Solar PV Cell. His work is motivated by the theory of Darwinian Evolution, how
                    the Darwinian Evolution evolved from some earlier evolution which could be only chemical and
                    physical? Did Darwinian Evolution exist before the first living cell arrived? Can something be
                    created from nothing? Therefore he believes that Darwinian Evolution results from Quantum Mechanical
                    Evolution and maybe other evolutions (chemical, physical) that were created in between. It is found
                    in Nature that the structure of all organisms has been designed to provide the capability of solving
                    a multitude of complex problems for both survival and growth, through instinctual, experiential, and
                    intellectual means. Even as environmental conditions change, it is the continuous adaptation process
                    of natural organisms adjusting to their environment, through evolutionary processes, which sustains
                    life. Nature itself has proven its development of robust system design. Based on his research
                    findings, over 50 papers have been published in peer-reviewed international journals and conference
                    proceedings. He is popular with the readers of science and technology books for his recently
                    published book titled “অদৃশ্য প্রযুক্তি” (Invisible Technology) which caught readers’ attention
                    since its availability. He is also the author of the book named “Programming in C”.
